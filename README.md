# Level-4-Task-28--Full-stack-with-React-and-Express

## Task

Follow these steps:

● Create an attractive React front-end that can be used to interact with the cars API you built with Express in the previous task.

○ You should be able to use your React front-end to get a list of cars, add additional cars to the list, modify the details about a specific car and delete a car from the list.

○ For a bonus challenge, make one of the car properties a URL to an image and display this image wherever you list a car item on your frontend.
